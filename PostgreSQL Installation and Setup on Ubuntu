PostgreSQL Installation and Setup on Ubuntu
1. Update System Packages
Before installing PostgreSQL, ensure that your system's package index is up to date:


sudo apt update
2. Install PostgreSQL
To install PostgreSQL 15, run the following command:


sudo apt install postgresql-15 postgresql-contrib-15
This will install PostgreSQL along with additional contributed utilities.

3. Check PostgreSQL Service Status
Once the installation is complete, verify that the PostgreSQL service is active:


sudo systemctl status postgresql
To start the PostgreSQL service if it's not running:


sudo systemctl start postgresql
You can also enable PostgreSQL to start automatically on system boot:


sudo systemctl enable postgresql
4. Access PostgreSQL Command Line
Log in to PostgreSQL as the postgres superuser:


sudo -i -u postgres
psql
This opens the PostgreSQL shell where you can run SQL commands.

5. Create Database and User
5.1 Create a New Database
To create a new database called filtrex_dev, use the following SQL command:


CREATE DATABASE filtrex_dev;
5.2 Create a New User
To create a user named filtrex_dev with a password:


CREATE USER filtrex_dev WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
5.3 Grant Privileges to the User
Grant the new user full access to the filtrex_dev database:


GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE filtrex_dev TO filtrex_dev;
5.4 Exit PostgreSQL
Once the database and user are created, exit the PostgreSQL shell:


\q
6. Test the Database and User
To verify that the user and database are working correctly, log in to the filtrex_dev database as the filtrex_dev user:


psql -U filtrex_dev -d filtrex_dev -W
You'll be prompted for the password (yourpassword). Once logged in, you can verify by listing the tables:


\dt
7. Allow Remote Connections (Optional)
If you want to allow remote connections to PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

7.1 Edit postgresql.conf
Open the PostgreSQL configuration file:


sudo nano /etc/postgresql/15/main/postgresql.conf
Find the listen_addresses setting and change it from localhost to * to allow connections from any IP address:


listen_addresses = '*'
7.2 Edit pg_hba.conf
Now, open the pg_hba.conf file:


sudo nano /etc/postgresql/15/main/pg_hba.conf
Add the following line to allow connections from any IP address:


host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5
7.3 Restart PostgreSQL
To apply these changes, restart PostgreSQL:


sudo systemctl restart postgresql
7.4 Open Firewall Port (if applicable)
If you're using a cloud service like AWS EC2, make sure port 5432 (the default PostgreSQL port) is open in your security group or firewall settings.

8. Backup and Restore (Optional)
8.1 Backup a Database
You can back up a database using pg_dump. For example, to back up filtrex_dev:


pg_dump filtrex_dev > filtrex_dev_backup.sql
8.2 Restore a Database
To restore a database from a backup file:

psql filtrex_dev < filtrex_dev_backup.sql
9. PostgreSQL Logs (if needed)
To check the logs in case of issues, PostgreSQL logs are typically found in:


/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-15-main.log
You can view them using:


sudo tail -f /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-15-main.log
